      <h1 id="mainHeading">Kellan's Monster of the Week Game: NPC Guide</h1>
      <p class="funParagraph" id="testP">Monster of the Week (MotW) is a tabletop-roleplaying game that plays off
         classic monster hunting media like "Scooby Doo" and "Buffy the Vampire Slayer".
         Players choose an archetype from the genre and build a character around the
         conventions surrounding that character type. The setting for my game is a
         modern, realistic urban fantasy world very similar to ours. I have an intricate
         web of NPCs (non-player characters) that the hunters (which is what MotW calls
         the player characters) interact with, go to for resources and extra muscle,
         and it can get a bit confusing for my players sometimes. I decided to make a
         nice little guide for them about those people. Most of these characters are vampires
         because they originate from a story I wrote when I was younger that focused on them, 
         so the distribution is disproportionate.

            <h2>Kristine Nightshade and ???</h2>
            <p>
               Kris (she/her) is a trans woman and a vampire who's been around for a few hundred years. She rarely talks about 
               herself or her past before she met <a href="#nikki">Nikki</a>. She and Nikki are "soul-bound" siblings, which essentially means
               that they're not related in the traditional sense but their magic drew them together when they needed each
               other most and created a sisterly bond between them. Kris sometimes says that Nikki is the only <em>real</em>
               sibling she's ever had, but if you ask her to elaborate, she will get uncomfortable and shut down completely. 
               She and <a href="#ellie">Ellie</a> met and started a relationship before she met Nikki, but Kris had to leave
               only to find out that Ellie had become pregnant. Having met <a href="#vincent">Vincent</a> at this point and fearing for the 
               safety of her girlfriend and future children, Kris asked if he could go help Ellie through the pregnancy
               and with raising on the children, because at the time it was unsafe for them to be associated with Kris (for 
               reasons she never elaborates on in the retelling of it all). Kris is polyamorous, and so was delighted to see
               Ellie and Vincent fall for each other, as she fell for Vincent as well, and now the three of them are happily
               in an open relationship. Now that whatever vague threat that kept Kris away from her family isn't a problem
               anymore, she lives with them and partakes in caring for the children and the house, though she is far more 
               restless than either of her partners.

            <h2>Nikki and Reina Maria Mendoza</h2>
            <p>
               Nikki (she/her) and Reina (she/her) are a newly married couple. Nikki (no last name given,
               just Nikki) is an ancient vampire that nobody knows exactly when she was born, but she does
               display an interest in ancient Japan. Her main weapon is an authentic samurai sword that she
               takes meticulous care of. She is extremely powerful, and her magic exceeds the limits of
               what most vampires are able to accomplish. She has a tendancy to be a bit too serious at
               times, but has become better at expressing herself as she has spent more time around
               <a href="#kris">Kris</a>. Reina is a young and passionate woman who met Nikki completely on 
               accident and was immediately smitten. Having no idea that Nikki was anything except human, Reina 
               respectfully but adamently pursued a relationship with her, and incidentally got swept up in a 
               conflict of supernatural scale. However, instead of dying immediately and painfully as Nikki had 
               feared (which was the reason she had been resisting Reina's advances so far, to keep her safe), 
               Reina more than held her own and escaped the situation basically unscathed. It was only then, and 
               when she accepted Nikki for everything she was once it was explained to her, did Nikki finally accept her
               advances. Reina is headstrong and spunky, a bit scrappy from growing up in a rough neighborhood but 
               she loves with her whole heart and helps Nikki relax and come out of her shell more.

            <h2>Sheri Young</h2>
            <p>
               Sheri (she/her) is a heavyset and proud young vampire. At less than a hundred years, she and her brother
               <a href="#vincent">Vince</a> have more life experience under their belt than they'd ever expected they
               would,
               but are still very much considered unworldly by most vampiric metrics. Sheri grew up being told that reading was
               unproductive and not something women did, and that her place was in the home. She spent the last few years of her
               mortal life as a nurse. She died to an act of racial violence, as they grew up during times of heavy segregation
               and hardship for African Americans. Vincent was the one who saved her by turning her into a vampire. Now, 
               Sheri specializes in different kinds of healing magic and spends her immortal life voraciously reading 
               anything and everything she can get her hands on to make up for a human life where she was denied the 
               privilege of unrestricted learning. She has become good friends with <a href="#caleb">Caleb</a> because of this, 
               and they trade books back and forth. She is incredibly kind and compassionate, and far smarter than most people
               she meets give her credit for on account of her Southern accent, which is heavier than her brother's.

            <a name=barry></a>
            <h2>Barry Young</h2>
            <p>
               Barry (he/him) is a fallen angel from the judeo-christian system. He was made by Yahweh at the beginning
               of time (as measured by the Christian bible at least--your mileage may vary) out of living wax, as all
               angels are. However,
               angels are considered to be above certain things that are associated with humanity, including gender. And
               Barry is a trans man. He created a new body for himself in secret, but was eventually found out and was
               stripped of his wings before being thrown from the skies. As a fallen angel, Barry is forced to walk the
               earth for the
               rest of eternity, able to use his full powers (sans flight) at the cost of excruciating pain. He is
               incredibly laid back, all things considered, and charismatic in a stoner kind of way. His past is a
               mystery, and it seems he
               intends to keep it that way, but his current life has him as a doting husband and family man alongside
               his wife, <a href="#sheri">Sheri</a>, and their three kids. He couldn't be happier about his current 
               lot in life, and therefore is particularly adament about keeping the past where it belongs: behind him.

            <a name=vincent></a>
            <h2>Vincent Abello-Young</h2>
            <p>
               Vincent (he/him) is <a href="#sheri">Sheri</a>'s older brother and became a vampire less than a year before 
               her. He does not remember how he died, or at least he claims not to, but noticably has sired the most 
               vampires out of anyone else in the group, including his sister, <a href="#caleb">Will</a>, as well as 
               at least a few others that he talks about. He does not view them as his children, as the relationship 
               between sires and their progeny holds no conventions or expectations. He and Will have had a casual, on
               and off romantic relationship since Vincent turned him, for example, while his relationship with his 
               sister has not changed in the slightest from how it was when they were human. When <a href="#kris">Kris</a>
               requested that he stay with <a href="#ellie">Eleanora</a> to help her through a supernatural pregnancy, 
               Vincent was more than happy to help. He'd always had a soft spot for children, but since he had a lot of 
               issues with toxic masculinity, was unsure of his ability to be a father, so helping with someone else's 
               children seemed the perfect compromise. What he wasn't expecting was to fall in love with <em>both</em>
               of them, to adore the children so strongly that he discovered he did in fact want some of his own, and 
               to settle happily into a domestic life with Ellie that included Kris when it was safe to.

            <a name=ellie></a>
            <h2>Eleanora Isabella-Amaya Garcia Abello-Young</h2>
            <p>
               Eleanora (she/her), known as Ellie to her friends, is a short Hispanic woman in her early forties. She is
               married to <a href="#vincent">Vincent</a>, and the two of them are in an open, polyamorous relationship
               with <a href="#kris">Kristine</a>. She's a very motherly figure in a stern and semi-traditional way, but
               will never let any of her children go a single day without knowing how much she loves them. The three of
               them have a total of six kids, the two oldest being <a href="#twins">the twins</a>. She had never considered
               engaging in polyamory until she met Kris, who has always been in open relationships. Ellie herself was 
               surprised to find she could love more than one person so deeply, but she fell for Vincent quickly and 
               was brought only joy to see Kris doing the same. She loves being a mother, and considering she has two 
               partners who can both impregnate her, is happily in a near-constant state of prenancy.

            <h2>Sophia and Luthar Abello-Young</h2>
            <p>
               Sophia (she/they) and Luthar (he/him) are biologically Kris and Ellie's children. They're the oldest
               among their
               siblings by almost a decade, and in human years are young adults. Sophia is a bit aloof, and very protective
               of Luthar, who is shy and mild-mannered. Sophia takes after her father <a href="#vincent">Vincent</a> 
               (which they both consider all three of their parents to be their parents and their siblings to be siblings, 
               regardless of blood relations) in being stoic and pretending she doesn't care as much as she does--and she 
               cares quite a bit. Luthar is sweet but a bit socially awkward, and looks up to <a href="#kris">Kris</a> a 
               lot, to the point where he isn't quite willing to accept her flaws. He likes kids and enjoys helping out 
               <a href="ellie">Eleanora</a> around the house. Luthar is still living at home while going to college while 
               Sophia has moved out and is working.

            <h2>Caleb Samuel Paige and William Abbott</h2>
            <p>
               Caleb (he/him) and Will (he/him) are a married couple that run a local bookstore called Mystic Books.
               Caleb started the store almost a decade ago as a passion project, and because of his high business acumen
               has been able to make enough money to allow Will to quit his job as a public defense attorney. Caleb is a
               charismatic businessman whose morals can be a bit flexible, though he will always remain loyal to those
               that are close to him. Will is a vampire, a very young one at that, and is the one who introduced Caleb
               to the existence of magic in the world. Caleb is now an incredibly powerful spellcaster, and his
               bookstore
               has become a hub of sorts for their community's supernatural population. Will is far too young of a 
               vampire to have had time to come to terms with what he is, and having been raised by a military family 
               with very strict morals, deals with a lot of inner turmoil. Despite what he believes and what he has 
               attempted to be in the past, William's a bleeding heart who wouldn't harm a fly if his life depended on it. 
               It's the reason he wasn't able to finish the police academy, along with the toxic environment that he 
               feared would be indicative of the job itself as well. He was far happier as a public defense attorney, albeit
               aggressively overworked as all are. He didn't feel he was making enough of a difference, and was relieved 
               to eventually be able to quit to help with the bookstore, where he can make a measurable difference amonst
               supernaturals. Caleb casually sees <a href="#kris">Kris</a> and is good friends and reading buddies with 
               <a href="#sheri">Sheri</a>, and Will sees <a href="#vincent">Vince</a>, who is also the one who made him a 
               vampire.

            <a name=kare></a>
            <h2>Kare Khaos</h2>
            <p>
               Kare (they/them) is a short, impish being of unknown origin. They describe themself as a djinn, but only
               because
               they find the word fun to say and not because it provides an accurate description of what they are. What
               is
               known about them is that Kare is a being made of pure magic--they were never human, and did not exist in
               any
               other form before this. They were also not born or made, and have no clue (nor much interest in) how old
               they
               are exactly. They're a spellcaster whose power is unfathomable, and they are able to perform any form of
               magic
               with ease. They're excitable and enthusiastic, curious likely to a fault, and while they don't
               particularly
               understand humans or other supernaturals, they always offer to help in ways they think will be useful.
               They are good friends with both <a href="#caleb">Caleb</a> and <a href="#kris">Kristine</a>, and are the 
               one that people call on when they have magical needs or problems that are beyond their capabilities.
